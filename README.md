# contraval

contraval (Contract Validator) is a tool
building abstract models of smart contracts. An 
EPROMELA model can be exposed to the SPIN model 
checker for:<br />


## Model checking 
 Verifying its logical consistency of the model
 against correctness properties written as 
 LTL (Linear Temporal Logics) formulae. <br />

## Testing
 Generating the execution sequences
 implicit in the model. Such sequences
 can be used as test cases against the
 actual implementation of the smaert
 contract.
