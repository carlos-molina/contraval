## contraval

contraval (Contract Validator) is a tool
writen in the EPROMELA language for building
abstract models of smart contracts. An 
EPROMELA model can be exposed to the SPIN model 
checker for:<br />
1) Verifying its logical consistency of the model
   against correctness properties written as 
   LTL (Linear Temporal Logics) formulae. <br />
2) Generating the execution sequences
   implicit in the model. Such sequences
   can be used as test cases against the
   actual implementation of the smaert
   contract.
