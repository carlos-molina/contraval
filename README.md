## contraval

contraval (Contract Validator) is a tool
writen in the EPROMELA language for building
abstract models of smart contracts. An 
EPROMELA model can be exposed to the SPIN model 
checker for:
#### Verifying its logical consistency.
#### Generating the execution sequences
   implicit in the model. Such sequences
   can be used as test cases against the
   actual implementation of the smaert
   contract.

#### Smart contracts
An executable contract (also called a smart contract) 
is (at least under my personal definition) a conventional 
contract that can be converted into executable code, 
executed and enforced programmatically at run-time.

#### Smart contracts and blockchain
The main feature of a smart contract is that its
executable and capable of monitoring and enforcing 
contractual commitments (rights, obligations and
prohibitions) at run--time.
